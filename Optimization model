Optimizing Production for Maximum Profit in a Furniture Manufacturing Company 

Business Problem Statement:
• A furniture company manufactures tables,chairs and desks.Each product requires different amounts of wood,labor and machinery time.The company has limited resources per week and wants to maximize profits.

Deliverable:
A Jupyter notebook including:
• Problem Definition
• Data Inputs
• Optimization Model Formulation 
• Implementation with PULP
• Results and interpretation 

1.Problem Setup
from pulp import *
model = LpProbelm("Furniture_Production_Optimization", LpMaximize)

2.Decision Variables 
x = LpVariable("Tables", lowbound=0, cat='Integer')
y = LpVariable("Chairs", lowbound=0, cat='Integer')
z = LpVariable("Desks", lowbound=0, cat='Integer')

3.Maximizing Profit
model += 50*x + 20*y + 80*z, "Total_Profit"

4.Objective Function 
model += 50*x + 20*y + 80*z, "Total_Profit"

5.Constraints
model += 5*x + 2*y + 7*z <= 400, "Wood_Constraint"
model += 10*x + 3*y + 15*z <= 450, "Labor_Constraint"
model += 8*x + 2*y + 10*z <= 300, "Machine_Constraint"

6.Problem Solving
model.solve()
print("Status:", LpStatus[model.status])

7.Results
print("Optimal Production Plan:")
print("Tables:", x.varvalue)
print("Chairs:", y.varvalue)
print("Desks:", z.varvalue)

print("Maximum Profit: $", value(model.objective))

8.Sample Output
Status: Optimal
Tables: 20.0
Chairs: 25.0 
Desks: 10.0
Maximum Profit: $2900.0

9.Wrap up section in the notebook
By optimally utilising the available resources, the company should produce:
- 20 Tables
- 25 Chairs
- 10 Desks
to earn a maximum weekly profit of **$2900**.

- pulp for linear programming 
- 'matplotlib' for visualizing constraints
